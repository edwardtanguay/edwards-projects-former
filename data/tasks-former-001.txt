- PROJECT: datapod-central
	- INFO
		- todos
			- for repos, have component that lists out links to /commits, /branches, etc.
				- perhaps even get information about them via the API
			- periodical todos
				- update node_modules on all dpods to reduce vulnerabilities
			- three kinds of projects
				- showcases
					- messy, try out everything, playgrounds of features and tools
				- templates
					- templates to use for the base of sites
				- dpods
					- has data parsing features
					- webpack that watches files and does the transformation on the fly with hot-reloading
				- apps
					- has some real purpose
					- read-recorder: record reading of articles like
						- https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com
						- https://uilicious.com/blog/accessibility-testing-interview-questions/#questions-about-common-definitions
						- with notes
			- responsive menu
				- https://www.alp-institut.de/aktuelle-befragungen/mietspiegel-berlin-2026/
			- url state
				- use https://nuqs.dev
			- create Datapod UI framework or design system
			- for all datapods, update package.json/name to correct name
			- redefine goal of Datapod: like screenscraping, database is lightly formatted text
			- watch folders
				- after change and 3 seconds wait, reparse data
		- goals
			- CBI - central batch input
				- go there, dump text, it gets parsed to the right site, e.g.
					- fc; vim; close all tabs but current; :tabonly
			- keep notes live on hetzner site so that working status is always reflected online ***
		- in all datapods
			- change backup npm script: create directory if doesn't exist
			- standardize the subtitle: this site made with Python and Nuxt 4, see the code
			- sophisticatedly responsive
			- readmes standardized
				- repo and live links
		- html5 templates
		- docmentation
			- explain "dpod" in spawning sites
			- git
				- git commits, use present tense, imperative mood
		- conventions
			- name variables after their classes, e.g. a ProjectItem object is not called "item" or "project" but "projectItem"
			- line variables ("::")
				- title::
				- idCode::
		- concepts
			- site-ready-to-go
				- base site is completely generic "Info Site"
				- if it is local, it asks you to customize it
			- hot files ***
				- edit file in vim
				- when you have state that you want to public, save
				- this creates an event which gets published
			- external<Item>
				- implies the expected shape of data coming from outside the site
			- raw<Item>
				- the actual data coming from outside the site
		- terminology
			- versioning
				- use SemVer: https://semver.org
				- SemVer allows:
					- x, y, and z to be non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...) with no upper bound.
					- So you can have versions like 3.27.104, 15.3.82, 99.125.7, etc.
					- The only rules are:
						- No leading zeroes (e.g. 01.2.3 is invalid).
						- All parts must be integers.
						- Valid: 0.1.0, 2.15.7, 10.34.99
						- Invalid: 03.2.1, 1.2.beta, 1.0.0-rc.01 (leading zero)
					- but it is common to have a preceding v
						- `git tag v1.0.1`
				- use tags and releases
					- https://github.com/edwardtanguay/git-commands-showcase/tags
			- take advantage of linux piping
				- output text that can be processed with sed, awk, bash, etc. ***
			- ParsedDpodFileLine
				- created on the first pass through a text file
				- basically a line from a text file
				- but it can also be a multiline line, e.g. with [[ and ]] markers
				- properties
					- isMultiline, bool
					- lines
			- ParsedDpodFileBlock
				- created on the second pass through a text file
				- a collection of smartLines separated by "white line space"
				- properties
					- blockMarker
					- smartLines
			- ParsedDpodFile
				- the result of "smart processing" a text file
				- gets it ready for more nuanced parsing
				- a collection of smartBlocks
		- spawning projects
			- tool to make backups of dpods and apps
		- roadmap
			- save array of objects in local storage and save the whole thing to backend, simple

		- quote; elixir, ruby; Elixir and Ruby definitely have a relationship, not in how they run, but in how they feel; 4.7
		- fact; elixir, ruby; José Valim, the creator of Elixir, was a core contributor to Ruby on Rails before building Elixir, he wanted something with Ruby's expressiveness and developer happiness, but with better performance for high-concurrency, fault-tolerant systems; 4.3
		- fact; elixir; Elixir is built on the BEAM, which is the Erlang virtual machine, Elixir and Erlang code are compiled by the OTP (Open Telecom Platform) and executed on the BEAM; 3.8
		- fact; elixir; start Interactive Elixir with `iex`; 2.3
		- fact; functionalProgramming; functional programming is declarative which means it focuses on what to solve instead of how to solve, it's compose of functions that return values without chaning the software state; 4.1
		- fact; functionalProgramming; functional programming avoids side effects and shared state by using pure functions and immutable data;4.2
		- quote; elixir,haskell; Elixir is dynamically typed, meaning types are checked at runtime. This makes Elixir easier to start with, but it doesn't offer the same level of type safety as Haskell.;4.2
		- quote; elixir; Elixir doesn't assign values to a variable, instead, Elixir binds a value to a variable;3.9
		- fact; elixir; if c = [a,b] where a=3 and b=20, then you rebind a=4, c is still a list [3,20], this is immutability;4.4
		- quote; elixir, ruby; If you have experience with Ruby, Mix in Elixir is like a mixture of Bundler, Rake and Gems.; 4.5
		- fact;go; Go has no static members or constructors, which affects design patterns like Singleon, nor does it have class-based inheritance or method overload which affects patterns like Visitor; 3.2
		- fact;go; Go has no has no support for error exceptions, but rather, errors are communicated back with return values, and so design patterns like Builder are affected by this kind of behavior; 3.4
		- fact;go; Go has no direct concept for abstract classes, so design patterns like Abstract Factory and Bridge, are affected by this;3.8
		- fact;designPatterns;Useful design patterns: Creational (Builder, Factory, Singleton), Structural (Adapter, Facade), Chain of Responsibility (Iterator, Observer)

		1. non-rhoticity: drop all final Rs, not [FAH-ther] but [FAH-tha]
		2. non-verlarized R and L, i.e. speak with a light R and L instead of a dark R and L: move these two sounds from the back of your throat (Texan) to the front of the lips (British)
		3. drop alveolar tap: 
			- butter, not [BUDDER] but [BUH-tah]
			- created, not [kree-AY-ded] but [kree-AY-ted]
			- setup, not [SEH-dup] but [SETT-upp]
			- got it, not [GAWD-it]; [GOTT-itt]
			- in the city
			- water
			- the former and the latter
			- what is the matter
			- it's clear what you're saying, not [wha-chur] but [what-yoo-ah]
			- little did I know
			- it was little
		4. drop consonant syllabification
			- button, not [BUH-n] but [BUTT-en]
			- certain
			- kitten
			- mountain
			- shouldn't, not [SHU-nt] but [SHUD-ent]
		4. employ palatalization of the "u": duty is not [DOO-dee] but [DYOO-tee]
		5. drop assibilition: education is not [eh-joo-KAY-shun] but [ehd-yoo-KAY-shun]
		6. vowels are pronounced clearly, openly and deliberately: noon not [noon] but [noooon]
		7. enunciate consonants: pronounce all Ts, Bs, Ps, etc. clearly and distinctly, and non-voiced consonants crisply
		8. in general, always speak deliberately and thoughtfully, which decelerates your speech but puts you in control
		9. not British
			- "and" is flat
		- you don't have to avoid or extend contractions
			- don't and can't is ok
		- practice
			- that shouldn't matter at all
			- pour all the water in the barrel
			- it's certain that we're going to go
			- it's our duty to meet at noon on Tuesday
			- it's unopinionated
			- but that shouldn't matter
			- they haven't gotten back yet
